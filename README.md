# Kaggle Microsoft Malware Prediction with ML.Net

This repository contains a Machine Learning implementation as I used for the Kaggle Microsoft Malware Prediction competition. It is created with ML.Net version 0.11 and based on .Net Core 2.2 runtime.

For more information and data about the competition: [Kaggle Microsoft Malware Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction)
With only some basic feature selection and feature encoding a 5-fold cross-validation was able to get a score of 0.683 on the public leaderboard. Given more time it could likely achieve the same scores as any comparable Python or R implementation.

## Prerequisites

To be able to run the code you need to have .Net Core 2.2 x64 (runtime or SDK) installed. Download it from the following [location](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). I developed and tested the code on Windows 10 but it should also run on Linux.

You also need to download the competition dataset from Kaggle.
